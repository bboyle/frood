# Contributing

## Important notes
Please don't edit files in the `dist` subdirectory as they are generated via Grunt. You'll find source code in the `src` subdirectory!

### Code style
Regarding code style like indentation and whitespace, **follow the conventions you see used in the source already.**
Learn more about [idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js/)â€”read the manifesto, particularly beautiful syntax!

### PhantomJS
While Grunt can run the included unit tests via [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), this shouldn't be considered a substitute for the real thing. Please be sure to test the `test/*.html` unit test file(s) in _actual_ browsers.

## Modifying the code
First, ensure that you have the latest [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) installed.

Test that Grunt's CLI is installed by running `grunt --version`.  If the command isn't found, run `npm install -g grunt-cli`.  For more information about installing Grunt, see the [getting started guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

You will also need [cucumber](http://cukes.info/) for acceptance tests. Cucumber requires [ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) or [jruby](http://jruby.org/) with [bundler](http://gembundler.com/) to manage ruby dependencies.

On Windows, I use my own [paranormal](https://github.com/bboyle/paranormal) portable dev environment.

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install` to install node dependencies (including Grunt).
3. Run `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies.
3. Run `grunt` to grunt this project.

Assuming that you don't see any red, you're ready to go. Just be sure to run `grunt` after making any changes, to ensure that nothing is broken.

## Submitting pull requests
